# **Basic Introduction**

** Ruby is an ideal object-oriented programming language. The features of an object-oriented programming language include data encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, data abstraction, operator overloading etc. **

## What is an interepted language?
*An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines, and then into another language (often machine code).*

## What is an object?
*Everything in Ruby is an object.All objects have an identity;they can also hold state and manifest behaviour by responding to messages.These messages are normally dispatched through method calls.*

## What is a method?
*A method in Ruby is a set of expressions that returns a value.With methods, one can organize their code into subroutines that can be easily invoked from other areas of their program. Other languages sometimes refer to this as a function. A method may be defined as a part of a class or separately.

## What are classes?
*A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. The object is also called as an instance of a class. *

## What are blocks?
*A ruby block is a way of grouping statements, and may apper only in the source adjacent to a method call; the block is written starting on the same line as the method call's last parameter.*
